# Base64 Encoder/Decoder Extension

## Description:
This is a browser extension that encodes and decodes media to and from Base 64. 

## Features:
- Select a file from your computer and encode it to a Base 64 string
- Convert a Base 64 string to the correct file type
	- Download the file

## Download:
This extension is updated and availible on the [Chrome Store](#).
Alternatively you can download the latest source code [release](https://github.com/dandeto/Base-64-Extension/releases).
That said, Chrome will prompt you to disable it every time you open the browser, so I highly advise downloading it from the store.

## Installation:
If you downloaded the source and want to run it as an extension, you need to do the following -
```
1. Extract it from the .zip archive
2. Open Chrome
3. Go to chrome://extensions
4. Check the box "Developer mode"
5. Drag and drop the folder
6. You will see it in the top right corner of your brower window
```
